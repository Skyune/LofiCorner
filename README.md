# Lofi Corner

The app's called "Lofi Corner" and it gives you a comfy place to rest and be productive without any distractions. Open the app, set yourself a goal and enjoy the atmosphere. It's basically 24 online lofi radio player + pomodoro timer to help students like myself well... study.

The rooms are going to have a character with unique animations in each of them, she'll be studying with you if you feeling lonely ðŸ™‚

[currently in development, expect bugs]
